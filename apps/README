Here are some tools that can be used to scan/tune DVB-T channels.
For each tool, un-tar its archive and use 'gmake' to compile it.

* scan-dvb-apps and tzap-dvb-apps come from the linuxtv website :
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/LinuxTV_dvb-apps

* w_scan comes from :
http://wirbel.htpc-forum.de/w_scan/index2.html

* dvbtools come from :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvbtools

* rc5watch is provided with the FreeBSD sms1xxx driver :

The conf/ directory contains French configuration files
(for Paris). They need freq_offset set to 166000.
