Hi,

this is a small channel scan tool for vdr which generates DVB-T and DVB-C channels.conf files.
It's 90% "scan" from linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0, the differences are:

- no initial tuning data needed, because scanning without this data is exactly
  what a scan tool like this should do
- it works *only* for cable and terrestrial DVB/ATSC, sat is removed
- it detects automatically which DVB/ATSC card to use.

1. Building w_scan
--------------------
Simply type 'make' in the source folder. (kernel sources required)

after that you may (optionally) install w_scan to /usr/bin:
make install


2. Basic usage
-------------------- 

2.a. DVB-C
./w_scan -fc >> channels.conf

2.b. DVB-T
./w_scan >> channels.conf

2.c. DVB-C and DVB-T
./w_scan >> channels.conf && ./w_scan -fc >> channels.conf

2.d. ATSC (terrestrial)
./w_scan -fa >> channels.conf

2.e. US Digital Cable (QAM Annex-B)
./w_scan -A2 >> channels.conf

2.f. ATSC, both terrestrial and digital cable
./w_scan -A3 >> channels.conf

2.g. generate (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data
./w_scan -x > initial_tuning_data.txt

2.h. generate kaffeine-0.8.5 channels.dvb
./w_scan -k > channels.dvb

For more sophisticated scan options see ./w_scan -h.


3. Usage of w_scan start script (optional)
-------------------- 

As i see that linux newbies may have problems in understanding
how to load dvb drivers, stopping vdr or copying files there is a
w_scan start script which may help you. 

(Nevertheless the usage as descripted in 2. Basic usage is still valid
this is only a script which guides you trough the complete scan process..)

What does the script do?
	1) stopping the vdr process
	2) loads the dvb drivers if not already loaded
	3) starts a DVB-T scan and after that a DVB-C scan with QAM64 and QAM256
	4) copies the channels.conf file generated to vdr's config directory
	5) restarts vdr

So if you already know how to do that steps, you don't need the script.
The script is started by the command 

./w_scan_start.sh


4. History
--------------------
2008-11-06
 - improved frontend detection (thanks to Hans Werner)
 - added a patch for single frequency scanning, see folder patches.
   This patch is not applied by default, if you need this feature,
   please apply patch and recompile. (thanks to Martin Dudok van Heel)
2008-08-15
 - added ATSC scanning support for terrestrial VSB & QAM Annex-B digital cable.
 (thanks to Michael Krufky)
 - removed vpid offset for H.264 channels
2008-07-20
 - added Copyright note, following the license of 'scan' from linuxtv-dvb-apps.
 - changed install location of {pci,usb}.{ids,classes} to /usr/share/w_scan
2007-12-09/2008-01-05
 - added H.264/AVC Video support
 - added ATSC A/53B Audio, ADTS Audio Stream, ISO/IEC 14496-3 Audio (not supp. up to now by vdr)
 (thanks to Steven Ellis)
 -additionally:
  -- support for ca-ids, no longer just setting ca-id=1 for encrypted channels
  -- support for language identifiers in vdr channels.conf
  -- no longer searching for 'other services' by default.
  -- added a lot of comments for information in moreverbose mode
  -- Makefile target dist added
2007-09-09
 - added kaffeine channels.dvb format, switch -k
2007-08-07
 - w_scan will no longer stop if frontend params cannot be set correctly.
   This is necessary, because newest mercurial dvb drivers seem to have sometimes
   difficulties with scanning complete frequency range. Additionally some cards added
   to pci.ids.
2006-09-03
 - added output format (dvb)scan initial-tuning-data
2006-09-01
 - applied w_scan-onid patch by Hartmut Birr which fixes that w_scan now
   records original_network ID instead of network ID
 - updated version of w_scan start script (which actually needs to be tested !)
2006-08-10
 - w_scan start script (first version)
2006-07-05:
 - removed QAM256 option "-Q", w_scan now uses either QAM_AUTO or (if not supported by hardware) 
   it will do a two-step scan starting with QAM64 and QAM256
2006-02-16:
 - changed initialization for all cards, fix for airstar2 dvb-t and avermedia 771 dvb-t
 - xine output option -X
 - added dvb-c frequencies 113MHz, 121MHz and 858MHz, dvb-c freqs revised
 - dvb-c now scanning sr=6900 *and* sr=6875 both by default, therefore removed option -s
 - this version is tested with
	- fujitsu-siemens dvb-c ff
	- cinergy t2 usb2.0 dvb-t
	- airstar2 dvb-t
	- avertv avermedia 771 dvb-t
	(please report other working/non-working cards to me..)
2005-07-11: first version
