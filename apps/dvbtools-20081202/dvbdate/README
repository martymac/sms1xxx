DVBdate 0.1
-----------

dvbdate is a simple program to set the system clock from the Time and Date
Table packets in a DTT stream.  It should be identical for setting time from
a D-SAT stream I think but I can't test that.

You need a DTT (any DVB?) card supported by the Linux DVB driver 
(www.linuxtv.org), I'm using a Hauppauge WinTV NOVA-T looking at the Sandy
Heath transmitter near Bedford, UK.

What it does
------------
'dvbdate' just looks at the TDT information from the currently tuned multiplex
and sets the clock to UTC.  (Which is what everyone run's their system clock 
at right?)
It would be trivial to change the program to use the Time Offset Table (TOT)
which contains information about local time, daylight saving etc.

All the DVB stuff is taken from Dave Chapman's DVBtune.


Installation
------------

I would recommend getting the very last ".tar.gz" source version and change
the include directory for the DVB stuff in the first line of the Makefile.

install using... 

make
make install

There is no configure script yet - it seems way to simple for that at 
this point but I probably should write one.

Usage
-----
'dvbdate' on it's own prints the date and time obtained from the currently
tuned multiplex.

Options
-------
  -p	Print the current system time and difference from DVB time.
  -q	Don't print anything apart from errors - make scripts quieter
  -s	Tries to set the system clock to the time obtained from DVB
  -f	If the system clock and DVB clock differ by more than 30 minutes,
	the time won't be set unless you specify this option.  This is really
	just a silly precaution.

BUGS
====
Probably.
I haven't tested the behaviour during daylight saving - but I think it should 
be OK.
