DVBtune 0.5
-----------

DVBtune is a simple tuning application for DVB cards supported by the
Linux DVB driver (www.linuxtv.org).

This is still very experimental - especially the XML output.

The latest release can be found at www.linuxstb.org.  You can contact
the author at <dave@dchapman.com>.

There is also a CVS repository (normally more recent than
linuxstb.org) available at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvbtools


Installation
------------

The package includes two applications - dvbtune and xml2vdr.

dvbtune has the option to dump the metadata from a DVB
transponder/multiplex into an XML file.  This XML file is hopefully
self-explanatory (i.e. I am too lazy to write documentation for it),
and should be read in conjunction with the DVB-SI standard (EN 300
468) available from www.etsi.org.

xml2vdr can convert this XML file into a "channels.conf" file suitable
for use with the VDR application.

In order to use the included "xml2vdr" utility, you should install the
latest version of libxml (Version 2) from www.xmlsoft.org.  I would
recommend getting the very last ".tar.gz" source version and install
using the standard 

./configure
make
make install

set of commands.

If you are using dvbtune for DVB-T in Finland, you should replace the
"make" command with "make FINLAND=1". or "make FINLAND2=1" (see the
comments in the dvb_defaults.h file for details).

Once you have installed libxml (if required), then you can compile
dvbtune and xml2vdr by just typing "make" in the dvbtune directory.

Usage
-----

Just type "dvbtune" by itself for the full list of options.

For simple tuning operations you can just use:

./dvbtune -f 12188000 -p h -s 27500 -v 163 -a 104 -t 32

to tune to a satellite transponder and set the video, audio and
teletext PIDs.

dvbtune also support DVB-T reception (currently for the UK only).  In
this case, you just need to specify the frequency:

./dvbtune -f 481833000

To get the DVB SI information for a multiplex, you can use the "-i"
option.  The output of dvbtune needs some addition lines before it is
a valid XML file.  e.g. use a script containing

echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>' > test.xml
echo '<satellite>' >> test.xml
./dvbtune -f freq -s srate -p pol -i  >> test.xml
echo '</satellite>' >> test.xml

to dump the SI for a satellite transponder.

This was done to allow you to write scripts to scan multiple
transponders and write the output to the same XML file.  See the
"scripts" subdirectory for examples.

Added Switch -n that adds a network interface and switch -m that
monitors the reception quality. Changed the tuning code. Added command
line parameters for spectral inversion. Changed code to allow L-Band
frequencies with -f switch
