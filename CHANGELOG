20090908:
    * Added support for 'FAMILY2' devices (SMS1102) :
        - Hauppauge WinTV MiniStick (25 years edition) works !
        - Other models should work, just give a try
          (and add VIDs/PIDs as necessary and send me your patches ;-))
    * Firmwares have been renamed, see the firmwares/ directory
        - A 'distinfo' file is also available for each firmware, allowing you
          to check your files against the firmwares used for development
    * HDTV has been successfully tested
        - Warning : only USB2.0 devices will deliver enough bandwidth, USB1.0
          devices will probably drop frames.
    * Fixed driver to allow using several devices at the same time
        - Moved 'mode' value to softc (also becoming a per-device sysctl)
        - Fixed demuxer clones' unit numbers assignment
    * Added compile-time default values for debug and freq_offset sysctls.
        - See SMS1XXX_DEBUG_DEFAULT_LEVEL and SMS1XXX_DEFAULT_FREQ_OFFSET
    * Added internal data dump function for unknown packets
    * Added device info dump for FAMILY2 devices when debugging is active

    * Use internal xfer's frame buffer instead of copying data during RX cb
20090711:
    * Converted code to use the new USB2 stack (FreeBSD 8.x)
