20100227 ('Let's play'):
    * Zapping bug with Mplayer fixed (thanks to Joerg Pulz !)
    * Better handling of special PID 0x2000
    * Demux device <-> filter mappings revised
    * Fixed race condition that could lead to a panic when
      fastly opening/closing demux0 device
    * Added sms1xxx(4) man page
    * Functionnalities Sync'ed with Linux kernel 2.6.33 (no changes)

20100203 ('First smile'):
    * Functionnalities Sync'ed with Linux kernel 2.6.33rc3
    * Added GPIO support (see README)
    * Added endianness conversions. The driver now *should*
      work on big-endian architectures (not tested)

20091121 ('Olive'):
    First of all, big THANKS to Hauppauge France, who lent me
    a French version of the WinTV Mistick HD. It has been
    successfully tested and works with this driver !

    * Added IR support (see the README file)
    * Updated firmwares' distinfos (new firmwares available upstream)
    * Functionnalities Sync'ed with Linux kernel 2.6.32, except :
      - Endianness conversions (currently little-endian only)
      - GPIO support
      - SDIO support
    * Bumped MAX_FILTERS (maximum active PID filters) from 16 to 32
    * Removed useless (and buggy) initial frequency tuning
    Additional internal changes:
    * Handling of new SMS11xx's statistics messages
    * DVR wakeups triggered only when DVB data received
    * Board models handling
    * Removed unused alignment macros
    * Moved statistics/debug code to sms1xxx-debug.{c,h}
    * Moved DVR init code to sms1xxx_demux_init
    * Fixed some return values in sms1xxx-usb.c

20090908:
    * Added support for 'FAMILY2' devices (SMS1102) :
      - Hauppauge WinTV MiniStick (25 years edition) works !
      - Other models should work, just give a try
        (and add VIDs/PIDs as necessary and send me your patches ;-))
    * Firmwares have been renamed, see the firmwares/ directory
      - A 'distinfo' file is also available for each firmware, allowing you
        to check your files against the firmwares used for development
    * HDTV has been successfully tested
      - Warning : only USB2.0 devices will deliver enough bandwidth, USB1.1
        devices will probably drop frames.
    * Fixed driver to allow using several devices at the same time
      - Moved 'mode' value to softc (also becoming a per-device sysctl)
      - Fixed demuxer clones' unit numbers assignment
    * Added compile-time default values for debug and freq_offset sysctls.
      - See SMS1XXX_DEBUG_DEFAULT_LEVEL and SMS1XXX_DEFAULT_FREQ_OFFSET
    * Added internal data dump function for unknown packets
    * Added device info dump for FAMILY2 devices when debugging is active

20090712:
    * Use internal xfer's frame buffer instead of copying data during RX cb

20090711:
    * Converted code to use the new USB2 stack (FreeBSD 8.x)
    * Removed set/getbufs IOCTLS
    * Code cleanup
    (Driver functionalities sync'ed with Linux kernel 2.6.30.1 - no change)

vvv Older versions (FreeBSD 7.x) vvv

20090601:
	* Sync'ed Linux headers with Linux kernel 2.6.29
	* Fixed includes and added a fake linux/types.h

20090331:
    * Merged fe_unc handling from Linux kernel 2.6.29

20081203:
    * 3rd-party apps updated

20081122:
    * Initial version
